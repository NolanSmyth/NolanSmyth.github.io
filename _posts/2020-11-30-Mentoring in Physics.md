The Society of Physics Students (SPS) and the Women in Physics and Astronomy (WiPA) mentoring program is gearing up to be in full swing for the Winter 2021 quarter at UCSC. We believe in the importance of support networks on the pathway to success, especially for those belonging to underrepresented communities in STEM. With this in mind, mentors will be supporters of their mentee's journey in Physics, in college, and in life, as opposed to serving as purely academic tutors. Here are some key points:

* Mentoring is available for both undergrads and grads. Students will be mentored by other students from a higher educational level

* No prior experience needed. Training will be provided to mentors.

* SPS and WiPA will also organize events (career workshops, panels, socialsâ€¦) to promote the interaction among all participants.

If you're an interested student from UCSC, please fill out the corresponding form by **Dec. 20, 2020**
