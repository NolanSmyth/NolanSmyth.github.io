### Microlensing Searches for Primordial Black Holes

[Here's](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.101.063005) a link to my recent paper on the prospect that [primordial black holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole) (PBHs) comprise a significant fraction of the dark matter. In short, by properly accounting for systematics in [microlensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing) searches, we showed that previous constraints on these objects are invalid for PBHs below a certain mass, opening the possibility that asteroid-mass PBHs make up 100% of the dark matter!
